Pedestrian pathways, vibrant open spaces offer integration for the community and provides significant \u201ceye on the street\u201d security. When complete, the master-planned community will span 22 acres and feature west coast modern residences on West Vancouver\u2019s Sentinel Hill. Residing at Evelyn is a park-like living experience. Private terraces provide homeowners with their own garden space, accentuated by the natural surroundings and trees.

Pride of ownership comes naturally here.\r\rEverything is easier when families have room to live and space to grow. Choose from 3-storey floor plans, ranging from 2,704 to approximately 3400 square feet. Each has unique interior features \u2013 such as a loft or a great room with double height ceilings, \u2013 and a few plans offer a master bedroom on the main floor. Customize the interior to suit your personal taste by choosing from one of two professionally designed colour schemes. There&#39;s no better way to make the house your home.\r\rSource: The Meadows",

                  "keyWordSearch": "Joyce Henriquez Partners Architects, Westbank Fitness Centre Outdoor BBQ &amp; Kitchen Rooftop Terrace Entertainment Lounge Play Area Urban Gardens Music Practice Room   The interior architecture philosophy of Westbank involves a holistic approach to design \u2013 the consideration of how public and private spaces should be experienced and how the design should enhance and build upon one\u2019s first response to a space to create a sophisticated and layered curated experience. This holistic method involves nurturing several key relationships with partners that share the same passion, dedication to design and commitment to excellence as Westbank. Through these relationships, we can create the quality of environment that allows continuous exploration and enjoyment.\r\r Our task at Joyce-Collingwood is to create a project that will bring a high degree of artistry and beauty to an already well-functioning neighbourhood. As such, our project is tailored to fit the community, adding vibrancy to the neighbourhood\u2019s streetscape and honouring the area\u2019s heritage.\r\rOne of the most important characteristics of this area is its attractiveness to families. To help foster family-living in the neighbourhood, we have made 65% of the homes at JOYCE two bedroom or larger, the highest percentage of family housing offered in a new development in Vancouver in generations. We have continued this thinking in the planning of the rooftop amenity space, where we have created space for a learning and activity lounge \u2013 with a multi-purpose entertainment lounge, library, private study rooms, a private listening room, and rooftop urban outdoor terrace for residents. With incredible views from Queen Elizabeth park to the North Shore mountains and downtown to the airport, there is little doubt this space will become a focal point for the residences of JOYCE.\r\rJOYCE is a direct manifestation of our commitment to creating beautiful projects that contribute social and cultural value to the communities in which we build. We have challenged ourselves to create something that will both honour the neighbourhood\u2019s heritage and cultures, while providing housing for this growing neighbourhood. We hope in the end you will see a level of effort and a degree of artistry reflected in our work that is befitting one of Vancouver\u2019s first, historic communities.\r\r\u2014 Ian Gillespie\r\rSource: Westbank",

NEU on 3rd features homes with garages, private front doors, and rooftop patios.\r\rThese townhomes are also designed to passive house standards which remarkably use as little as 10% of the energy a standard home uses. How? German technology is hard at work in NEU&#39;s insulation, HVAC system, window glazing, and appliances.\r\rThis attention to design and passive technology is a winning combination.

The vertically stacking cubic volumes will counter the pure verticality of the urban grid, amplifying the existing neighbourhood and context, and creating a unique connection between urban and natural surroundings. At the base, the buildings will be connected by a multi-storey \u2018bridge\u2019 that connects residents to internal courtyards, public amenities, communal spaces and gardens. We are also proud to be delivering well over 200 community housing suites for the benefit of Vancouver citizens.\r\rSource: Barclay x Thurlow - Bosa Properties",

So in winter, the system transfers the humidity from the air being extracted to the incoming fresh air to help keep the ambient humidity level at a reasonable value at all times. In summer, the humidity transfer reverses and the humidity in outside air is removed before it is injected into the home. This saves energy by reducing the load on your AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM\r\rDeluxe Kitchens\rThese beautifully engineered kitchens combine both craftsmanship and ingenuity, providing a sleekly designed backdrop for all your culinary needs.

                  "keyWordSearch": "Aquila Formwerks Architectural, Sterling Pacific Developments Inc.   A Remarkable New Community in West Vancouver\u2019s\rEagle Harbour Neighbourhood.\r\rAnyone who lives in Eagle Harbour can appreciate the myriad incredible benefits the community has to offer. Only steps from the beach, marinas, trails and lakes, yet it is also minutes from a variety of amenities such as schools, shops and services.\r\rAquila is an infill development of just under five acres. It is bordered by the CN Railway, Westport Road, Eagle Creek and the homes that are accessed from Daffodil Lane and Cranley Drive. As it is an infill development, we strive to ensure that large green buffers are provided to the neighbouring homes through park and wetland dedication. In fact, one third of the entire property will function as green buffers.\r\rThe residents of West Vancouver were asked for their input regarding the difficulties surrounding housing availability and the changes they desired to see in the availability of such housing for seniors, young families with children; giving life to the new Official Community Plan. Prior to the passing of this new OCP, the Aquila property was approved for subdivision into ten large lots. The ten large lots no longer align with the OCP, in fact the 10 lots completely contradicts it. The OCP clearly states that ostentatious homes on large lots catering to the wealthy elite are no longer desired, needed or wanted. Homes built for the \u201cmissing middle\u201d market is what West Vancouver requires; homes that allow young families to move to and downsizers to remain in West Vancouver.\r\rEagle Harbour is the ideal area in West Vancouver for this \u201cmissing middle\u201d development. Families can stroll down to Eagle Harbour beach and go for a walk on the scenic Sea View walk, while retirees can spend their time golfing at Gleneagles Golf Course or enjoy their time at the various marinas or yacht clubs.\r\rThere is no question that Eagle Harbour is the perfect location for Aquila and West Vancouver\u2019s \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing. Because of the broad market (young families to downsizers) that Aquila strives to accommodate, diverse housing types and sizes are essential. Aquila is proposing to offer three and four bedroom homes with duplex and attached format ranging in size from 1300 to 3200 sqft.\r\rIn creating the new proposal for this property, Sterling Pacific has worked closely with West Vancouver to develop a plan that follows the core values of the new OCP. Sterling Pacific has worked diligently with Formwerks Architects to create the homes that fit seamlessly into the community, while recognizing that such density in an infill development requires the utmost care and attention. Dedicated to making a positive an impact on the community, the density Sterling Pacific is proposing is by far the lowest of any recently approved or proposed multifamily development in West Vancouver, with a floor area ratio of only 0.45 and a total of 53 homes.\r\rThe Harper family, owners of Sterling Pacific developments, reside in the area and have put forth a plan that they are proud of; a plan that they believe fits into their neighbourhood and only serves to enhance the neighbourhood\u2019s already distinctive and extraordinary character.\r\rSource: Aquila",
